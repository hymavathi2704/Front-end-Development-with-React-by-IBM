Welcome to Front-End Application Development with React
In this course, you will focus on client-side JavaScript and frameworks development with React. 

In Week 1, you will explore how to access the React web framework user interface (UI) library and run a simple React application. You will investigate ways to use React components and change their properties and states in a dynamic UI. 

In Week 2, you will learn more about state and props in React and how they manage data in an application. In this week, you will also get an insight into the three phases of a component lifecycle, practice connecting to an external server from a React page, and learn the different approaches to testing a component. 

In Week 3, delve into new features like Hooks and Redux to write advanced components. You will also perform a hands-on exercise on how Hooks handle events and logics in functional components without using classes. 

In Week 4, you will create a React Budget Allocation app in the final project. You will explore actions, reducers, and the dispatch function. Finally, you will create a code file, save it, and edit it to make changes.
